	<h2>Bored? was created by a procrastinator<br>that appreciates crappily made 90's infomercials,<br>also thinks that they are by far the best time killers.
	</h2>
	<p>Heavily inspired by 'The Useless Web' and 'Free Real Estate memes', this website is to remember what great infomercials we were perpetually exposed to in the past, and also to share them with new generations who never had the experience with them.
